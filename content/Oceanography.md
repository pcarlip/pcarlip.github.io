My current research focuses on ocean mixing and turbulence. My goal is to improve our 
understanding of how energy and other flow properties move between scales, which is 
important for ensuring the accuracy of large-scale ocean models which can't directly
simulate turbulence at smaller scales. I am working with structure functions, which 
connect energy dissipation and related variables to the differences between flow 
variables (such as velocity and advection) at different grid points. These methods have
a long history in isotropic flows, but there is substantial work remaining to develop 
and improve them for flow fields with directional dependence.
