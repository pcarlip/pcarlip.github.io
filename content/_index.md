### About Me

I'm a Physical Oceanography PhD student at Oregon State University, where I'm advised 
by [Dr. Brodie Pearson](https://brodiepearson.github.io/). I work on [computational 
modeling and analysis of ocean mixing and turbulence]({{% ref "/Oceanography"%}}). 

Before I started grad school, I worked on [CFD for college rocketry]({{% ref "/Rocketry"%}}),
[combinatorics related to quantum gravity]({{% ref "/Causal-sets"%}}), and 
[ODE models of protein interactions]({{% ref "/Cell-signaling"%}}).
