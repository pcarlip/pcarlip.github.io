### About Me

{{<figure

    alt="Peter Carlip"
    class="right">}}

I'm a Physical Oceanography graduate student at Oregon State University, where I'm advised 
by [Dr. Brodie Pearson](https://brodiepearson.github.io/). This site is currently under 
construction, and probably has some errors at the moment.
